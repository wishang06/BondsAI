Full Interview Transcript:

1. USER: my name is michael and i am studying bachelors of commerce majoring in finance and diploma in mathematical sciences

2. ASSISTANT: Hello Michael, it's great to meet you! It sounds like you have a strong foundation in both finance and mathematics, which is excellent for a career in quantitative trading. Could you share a bit more about your educational journey? For instance, what drew you to finance and mathematical sciences, and how have your studies been shaping your interests in trading?

3. USER: I always had an interest in maths since a young age, competing in Mathematical competitions such as CAD and maths oplympiads. later in life i got more interested in commerce and finance when i started to do manual trading for fun

4. ASSISTANT: That's fantastic, Michael! It sounds like you have a strong passion for mathematics and a natural curiosity about finance, which is a great combination for quantitative trading. Participating in competitions like CAD and math olympiads shows your commitment and capability in mathematics. Could you tell me more about your manual trading experience? For instance, what kind of strategies did you use, and what did you learn from the experience that you think would be beneficial in a quantitative trading role?

5. USER: I would take the most recent new and analyse the data with ai

6. ASSISTANT: That's a very forward-thinking approach, integrating AI with data analysis to inform your trading decisions. Using AI for data analysis can provide significant insights and is a critical skill in quantitative trading. Could you walk me through a specific example or experience where you successfully applied this method? I'm particularly interested in understanding the process you followed, any challenges you faced, and the outcomes of your efforts.

7. USER: Lets talk about the algothon i participated in in which i used a algorithm to traded, the code was to pick the first ten stock based on sharp-scores which is made up by CAPM value from the first few days of data updating every few days. at the start it was difficult to get a high score, but after i made a backtester which made all the mistakes clear

8. ASSISTANT: That sounds like an impressive project, Michael. Participating in an Algothon and developing an algorithm based on Sharpe ratios and CAPM values demonstrates both your technical skills and your strategic thinking.
