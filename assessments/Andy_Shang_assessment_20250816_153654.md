Full Interview Transcript:

1. USER: Hi I'm Andy Shang, a first year bachelor's of science student, majoring in Data Science at the University of Melbourne

2. ASSISTANT: Hello Andy, it's great to meet you! Thank you for joining us today. As you're in your first year, you must be gaining a lot of foundational knowledge. Could you share more about your experience so far in your studies? Specifically, what subjects or areas have you found most engaging or challenging?

3. USER: Great to meet you too! I was drawn to data science because it combines my interests in mathematics, statistics, and problem-solving with practical applications that can have real-world impact. From the start of my degree, I’ve enjoyed courses in probability, statistics, and computational modelling, as they give me the tools to analyse complex datasets and extract meaningful insights.  One project I particularly enjoyed involved developing a pipeline to process and summarise large sets of textual data, where I applied Python and machine learning techniques to extract actionable insights. I found it exciting to see theoretical concepts come to life in a practical, results-driven project, and it reinforced my interest in applying data science skills to dynamic, high-stakes environments like quantitative trading.

4. ASSISTANT: That's wonderful to hear, Andy. It sounds like you have a solid foundation and a passion for applying your skills in practical settings. Your project on processing and summarizing textual data with Python and machine learning is quite relevant to quantitative trading, where data-driven insights are crucial.

Could you elaborate on how you approached this project? Specifically, what problem-solving strategies did you employ, and what challenges did you face during the development process?

5. USER: In those competitions, I mainly used **Python** for both strategy development and data analysis, relying on **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** for preprocessing, statistical modelling, and backtesting. In the IMC Trading Simulation, I also worked with **real-time simulation APIs** to process live order book data and generate trades with minimal latency.  For continuous learning, I take a structured approach:  * **Daily problem-solving** to sharpen quantitative and coding skills. * **Competitions and side projects** to apply concepts under realistic, time-pressured conditions. * **Ongoing reading and research** on finance, market microstructure, and new ML techniques. * **Peer collaboration** to exchange ideas, debug challenges, and gain new perspectives.  This keeps my skills sharp, adaptable, and aligned with the latest tools and market developments.

6. ASSISTANT: It sounds like you've developed a comprehensive approach to learning and skill enhancement, which is incredibly valuable in the fast-paced world of quantitative trading. Your hands-on experience with Python, real-time simulation APIs, and continuous learning strategies aligns well with what we look for in a candidate.

I'm curious about your teamwork and collaboration experiences. Could you share a situation where you worked with peers on a project or competition? How did you contribute to the team, and what did you learn from that experience?

7. USER: In team settings, I focus on **clear communication, role clarity, and proactive support**. For example, during the IMC Trading Simulation, my team divided responsibilities between data analysis, model development, and strategy implementation. I made sure everyone had access to shared resources and that our code was well-documented, so integration was smooth.  There was one instance where we disagreed on a parameter adjustment that could significantly affect risk exposure. I suggested we run a **quick backtest with both approaches**, review the results together, and then decide based on data rather than intuition. This not only resolved the disagreement but also strengthened our model and reinforced trust within the team. Ultimately, our coordinated efforts and open communication allowed us to deliver a robust strategy that performed consistently throughout the simulation.

8. ASSISTANT: That's a great example of effective teamwork and leadership, Andy. Your approach to conflict resolution through data-driven decision-making is particularly impressive, as it not only enhanced your strategy but also built trust and cohesion within your team. This kind of collaborative spirit is essential in quantitative trading.

Looking towards the future, how do you see your career developing in the field of quantitative trading? What motivates you to pursue this path, and what are your long-term goals?

9. USER: What excites me most about quantitative trading is the combination of **real-time problem-solving, data-driven decision-making, and continuous learning**. Every market scenario is different, and I enjoy designing strategies that can adapt quickly while having a measurable impact.  My long-term goal is to become a trader who can not only develop high-performing strategies but also mentor and collaborate with others to build a strong, innovative team. I see myself contributing by **bringing analytical rigor, coding expertise, and a proactive mindset** to the table, while fostering a culture of knowledge sharing and experimentation. By combining technical skills with teamwork and creativity, I hope to help the firm continuously innovate and stay ahead in dynamic markets.

10. ASSISTANT: Your vision for the future in quantitative trading is quite inspiring, especially your focus on innovation, mentorship, and collaboration. It aligns well with our values of continuous learning and entrepreneurial spirit. Your enthusiasm for data-driven decision-making and strategy development, coupled with your technical skills, positions you well for a successful career in this field.

As we wrap up, is there anything specific you would like to add or any questions you have about the program or the company?

11. USER: My career goal is to become a quantitative trader who can design and refine data-driven strategies that perform in real, fast-moving markets. I’m motivated by the mix of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback — every trade is a live test of your ideas. What excites me most is the combination of deep quantitative analysis, coding, and decision-making under uncertainty, where small improvements can have a big impact. The pace, problem-solving, and constant learning environment are exactly what I thrive in.
